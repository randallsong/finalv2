Phase 1:

What is your idea?
A site where users can sign up for and read/write fantasy stories in an ever-expanding universe.

MVP
Users can sign in, sign out, create user
People without an account can still read the site’s content, they just can’t create any of their own
Users can send each other messages/mail through the site to collaborate on projects, and collaborators can be added to projects to give them permission to edit it
Admins can delete user-created content if it doesn’t coincide with the rules of the site
Any User-created content can have comments from other users providing feeback

post MVP
Users can instant-message each other
Users can be emailed if they have a new message in their account’s inbox, or if something was deleted in accordance with the site’s rules
Implement a ratings system on user-created content that either alerts an administrator about the situation so that they can decide whether or not to delete the conent.

Create a site where a collective story/universe can be supported and expanded by gathering like-minded writers, and constantly expand the content within guidelines that encourage creativity without letting it get out of control.
